# Custom-Allo-Styles

I personally prefer the new look of the Android Messages web app. So my friend and I took it upon our selves to make an unruly amount of style changes to the Allo for Web page. To accomplish this we used the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylebot/oiaejidbmkiecgbjeifoejpgmdaleoha">Stylebot Chrome extension</a>. 
Once the extension is installed, navigate into the 'options->styles->add new style' of the extension then type in the url for allo (https://allo.google.com/web) then paste the css from the styles.css file. 
Make sure you install the <a href="https://devfiles.co/download/vSxQjI5P/Google-Sans-Font.zip">Google Sans font</a> as well and boom! You may need to restart chrome in order for it to recognize the new font.

I hope you all enjoy. Feel free to suggest additional changes or mention if i've missed something.

If you have any questions on getting it working let me know.

I plan on making an Allo-tized theme of this using some different colors to make it easier to differentiate from Messages for Web.
